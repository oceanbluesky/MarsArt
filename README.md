CC0 Use it, abuse it. (We'd appreciate it if you add your own similar models for vehicles, suits, habs and such to help create a permanent open-source repository of resources for depicting human settlement of Mars. After your commercial project, why let your work die on a hard drive? Sell your component models on [Turbosquid](http://turbosquid.com) then drop a copy here for free use by fellow artists ;)
